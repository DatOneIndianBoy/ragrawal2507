- Heyoo, I’m Rudra and I am a high school freshman from Australia
- I’m interested in technology, engineering (mainly mechatronics) and Biotechnology!
- I’m currently learning Python through Harvard's Computer Science 50 (CS50 for short) courses
- In the next 5 years, I hope to start research on how nanobots can combat disease cells such as cancer and how we can make them (both physically and how we can code them)
